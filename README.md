# Animals_Classification_Streamlit
This web application is built to classify animals using convolutional neural networks with a user internface built using streamlit.

In this repository, I have built a convolutional neural network for predicting different types of animals.

The results of this CNN is shown interactively by using Streamlit where users can select images from list and then look at the 
results which are predicted by the network.

I have used the data from https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99/animals10/download
